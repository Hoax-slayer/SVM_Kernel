# SVM_Kernel

Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features.
